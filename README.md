# Data-Analyser
Hackathon project for Mercor Hackathon
Track: AI
A basic data analyser that uses ai to know which graphs to generate and shows them. 

## How did I go about it?
I did it using flask, render.com and streamlit


## Deployment
The Streamlit app is deployed here: [Data-Analyser](https://huggingface.co/spaces/siddhartha-mahajan/data-analyser). 

API call on CMD: ```curl -X POST -F "file=@data.csv" https://data-analyser.onrender.com/analyze```

where "data.csv" is the file you want to analyze.
